Webster and Company,"Beard, Daniel Carter",Poor,500,Aaron & Tina's,"Novel, Fiction",,575,,"This novel tells the story of Hank Morgan, the quintessential self-reliant New Englander who brings to King Arthur’s Age of Chivalry the “great and beneficent” miracles of nineteenth-century engineering and American ingenuity. Through the collision of past and present, Twain exposes the insubstantiality of both utopias, destroying the myth of the romantic ideal as well as his own era’s faith in scientific and social progress.  A central document in American intellectual history, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court is at once a hilarious comedy of anachronisms and incongruities, a romantic fantasy, a utopian vision, and a savage, anarchic social satire that only one of America’s greatest writers could pen.","First Edition, Second State, lacking an ""S"" between ""The King"" on page 59.

Here are talented tomboy and author-to-be Jo, tragically frail Beth, beautiful Meg, and romantic, spoiled Amy, united in their devotion to each other and their struggles to survive in New England during the Civil War. It is no secret that Alcott based Little Women on her own early life. While her father, the freethinking reformer and abolitionist Bronson Alcott, hobnobbed with such eminent male authors as Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne, Louisa supported herself and her sisters with ""woman’s work,” including sewing, doing laundry, and acting as a domestic servant. But she soon discovered she could make more money writing. Little Women brought her lasting fame and fortune, and far from being the ""girl’s book” her publisher requested, it explores such timeless themes as love and death, war and peace, the conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, and the clash of cultures between Europe and America.",First Printing.

Today forty-three of his plays are known by title; eleven survive. The most famous of these is the whimsical fantasy Lysistrata.  A perennial classroom and stage favorite as well as the basis of Spike Lee's Chi-Raq, the play is as relevant today as it was 2,500 years ago. The premise is simplicity itself: to end the Peloponnesian War, women decide to withhold sex from their husbands until the fighting stops.  The play is by turns raucous, bawdy, frantic, and funny. David Mulroy's exciting new translation retains the original's verse format, racy jokes, and vibrancy-setting it apart from previous efforts, which are typically reproduced as prose or depart from meaning and meter. His introduction offers a concise summary of Aristophanes' life and social milieu, including a brief overview of the Peloponnesian War, which took place during the playwright's lifetime. The appendices include guides on translating meter and Greek pronunciation for aspiring thespians.",Sandglass included.,covers/admin/4.jpg,1

(Bill Clinton is the 42nd president, but Grover Cleveland was elected president twice, before and after Benjamin Harrison, making him the 22nd and 24th president.) The Kunhardt family are producers of both historical books and documentaries, and their television background is evident in the visual emphasis within The American President--which, as it happens, is also being turned into a television documentary. Another thing that sets the book apart from countless others on the presidents is its unique organization. The presidents are not presented in chronological order, but grouped instead according to characteristics that personified them and their presidencies. For example, Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson are brought together in a chapter on professional politicians, John Adams and Jimmy Carter share space for their ""Independent Cast of Mind,"" and Theodore Roosevelt and Richard Nixon are noted for ""Expanding Power.""

He became notable for his Kon-Tiki expedition, in which he sailed 8,000 km (5,000 mi) across the Pacific Ocean in a self-built raft from South America to the Tuamotu Islands in 1947. The expedition was designed to demonstrate that ancient people could have made long sea voyages, creating contacts between apparently separate cultures. He is the author of another important text, Aku-Aku, this time focusing on the secrets and mysteries of Easter Island. This was linked to a diffusionist model of cultural development. Heyerdahl subsequently made other voyages designed to demonstrate the possibility of contact between widely separated ancient peoples. He was appointed a government scholar in 1984. In May 2011, the Thor Heyerdahl Archives were added to UNESCO's ""Memory of the World"" Register. At the time, this list included 238 collections from all over the world. The Heyerdahl Archives span the years 1937 to 2002 and include his photographic collection, diaries, private letters, expedition plans, articles, newspaper clippings, original book and article manuscripts.

From his classroom window, he would gaze at the windblown clouds, mesmerized by airborne creatures such as birds, butterflies and winged insects. He sometimes dreamed of riding on the back of a bird and flying away to faraway places.  Yamamoto’s career as a photographer began in 1993. One of Japan’s most important living photographers, Yamamoto has taken many different approaches to photography over the past 20 years. But what has remained constant is the artist’s belief that humans are just a small part of nature, united with it and part of it. Throughout his career, Yamamoto has often returned to animals, particularly birds, as a subject, reflecting his childhood fascination with the creatures and his eternal commitment to the unity of humanity and nature. With Tori, the photographer departs on yet another artistic journey, with a new series of quietly moving animal images (tori means “bird” in Japanese).

68,Masterpieces of Painting in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,"Virch, Claus",1970,Softcover,Metropolitan Museum of Arts,N/A,"Good, used",35,Aaron's Place,"Art, Museum",,,N/A,"Here, each one reproduced in full color, are a hundred of the Museum's finest paintings, carefully chosen to offer a broad account of periods and styles. Eighty-five of the works are from European schools—Italian, Flemish, Dutch, German, Spanish, British—ranging in time from an Epiphany by Giotto to Picasso's portrait of Gertrude Stein. The rest are American paintings, beginning with canvases by Pratt, Copley, and Stuart, continuing with Sargent, Homer, and Eakins, and concluding with a work by Morris Louis, painted in 1961. Long-time favorites are here (Bruegel's The Harvesters, El Greco's View of Toledo, Veronese's Mars and Venus United by Love, Watteau's Mezzetin) as well as extraordinary recent accessions (Rembrandt's Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer, La Tour's Fortune Teller, Monet's Terrace at Sainte-Adresse). Each reproduction is accompanied by comment on the painting's origin and significance. Expressly written for this book, these comments are the work of two of the Museum's experienced writers, Edith A. Standen and Thomas M. Folds. Introducing the publication, Claus Virch, Curator of European Paintings, gently warns persons who may unconsciously, through conditioning in our world of superabundant illustrations, settle for a color reproduction in place of the real thing. A book such as this, he notes, first of all hopes to prepare its ""readers"" for confrontations with the actual paintings. Second, it hopes to guide or refresh memories of the actual paintings. The aptness here of such reminders is partly a tribute to the care with which the hundred reproductions have been color-corrected and seen through the press. The book should appeal to a wide range of readers, both as a splendid sample of the Metropolitan's paintings collections and a stirring reminder of great achievements in art across a span of nearly seven centuries.",N/A,covers/admin/68.jpg,1

Enter Dr. Frederick Schwarz, a ""pathologist of Communism"" who had already spent more than twenty years in the study of Communism's basic ideas. At Dr. Billy Graham's suggestion, Dr. Schwarz formed the United States Christian Anti-Communism Crusade (CACC). For the next four decades, the CACC was the steel spine of the American anti-Communist movement, helping to educate such great anti-Communist leaders as Ronald Reagan. Beating the Unbeatable Foe is Dr. Schwarz's first-hand account of his lifelong battle against Communism, his devotion to truth and freedom, and his vibrant Christian faith.",First Edition. ,covers/admin/159.jpg,1

According to Sloane, American Yesterday explores ""our national attic of vanishing ways and obsolete occupations."" Impressed by the artistry and sturdy realism of pioneer builders, he takes genuine delight in exploring the unique careers of barber-surgeons, dowsers, tithingmen, sawyers, nailers, plumbum-men, and a great variety of artisans, illustrating the activities, customs, and things created by the people who made their living in ""antique ways."" Sloane, a devoted student of early Americana, speaks lovingly of the people who spent much of their lives creating wardrobe closets, foot stoves, church pew armrests, grindstones, featherbed patter paddles, charcoal burners, English phaetons, giant hogsheads, drovers' sleighs, windowsill sundials, and other items of long ago. Credited with ""doing gallant service, preserving records of the ways and the means of the forefathers who got along well with the resources now long forgotten"" (Springfield Republican), Eric Sloane has written an immensely enjoyable book that will enchant anyone who takes pleasure in reading about the past and views its artifacts as part of a rich national heritage.",,covers/admin/164.jpg,1

It saw Lincoln's assassination just five days later and a near-successful plot to decapitate the Union government, followed by chaos and coup fears in the North, collapsed negotiations and continued bloodshed in the South, and finally, the start of national reconciliation.  In the end, April 1865 emerged as not just the tale of the war's denouement, but the story of the making of our nation.  Jay Winik offers a brilliant new look at the Civil War's final days that will forever change the way we see the war's end and the nation's new beginning. Uniquely set within the larger sweep of history and filled with rich profiles of outsize figures, fresh iconoclastic scholarship, and a gripping narrative, this is a masterful account of the thirty most pivotal days in the life of the United States.",First Edition. ,covers/admin/176.jpg,1

Libertine, brawler, thief, scholar, rake, murderer, Villon was a citizen of Paris and a lover of its teeming streets, the sounds and sights of which fill his works: ""The Legacy"", ""The Testament"", ""Miscellaneous Poems"", and ""Poems in Slang"". The works of the man who has been called the key figure in modern poetry are presented here in a fresh, free-verse English translation as well as in the original French. The design of the book is such that the French text and the English translation face each other on opposite pages, line for line, verse for verse. Along with the brilliant introduction by William Carlos Williams, the volume contains a short biography of Villon, a foreword concerning the text, translation, and notes, as well as a bibliography and an index of first lines, both in French and in English.",,covers/admin/301.jpg,1

It gives us an unflinching view of the fabric of this country from the point of view of the people who keep it all moving. The more than 120 roughly textured monologues that make up Gig beautifully capture the voices of our fast-paced and diverse economy. The selections demonstrate how much our world has changed--and stayed the same--in the three decades prior to the turn of the millennium. If you think things have speeded up, become more complicated and more technological, you're right.  But people's attitudes about their jobs, their hopes and goals and disappointments, endure. Gig's soul isn't sociological--it's emotional. The wholehearted diligence that people bring to their work is deeply, inexplicably moving. People speak in these pages of the constant and complex stresses nearly all of them confront on the job, but, nearly universally, they throw themselves without reservation into coping with them. Instead of resisting work, we seem to adapt to it. Some of us love our jobs, some of us don't, but almost all of us are not quite sure what we would do without one.  With all the hallmarks of another classic on this subject, Gig is a fabulous read, filled with indelible voices from coast to coast. After hearing them, you'll never again feel quite the same about how we work.",Gift from Davide Agnelli,covers/admin/342.jpg,1

This work includes: chronological depiction of the fine arts from their origins in Rome through the late baroque and rococo; explanation of the socio-political background: the Counter-Reformation, the development of Protestantism, absolutism, and the French Revolution; and various ways the baroque left its mark, including city planning, architecture, garden design, sculpture, painting and emblems. During the baroque period, architecture and the other fine arts were the instruments of a staging of ""world theatre"" on a grand scale. The baroque art of the popes in Rome, the displays of power and opulence in the court of the Sun King, Louis XIV, and Dutch painting - they all reflect different aspects of the underlying tension between pleasure in life and fear of death that was such a prominent feature of the baroque world view. This volume portrays the entire span of the fine arts of the baroque era, from rich splendour to religious asceticism.",,covers/admin/352.jpg,1

672,"Reclaiming America: Nike, Clean Air, and the New National Activism","Shaw, Randy",1999,Paperback,University of California Press,Prestige Typography,Good,10,Sycamore:,Politics,,,N/A,"Have activists taken the bumper-sticker adage ""Think Globally, Act Locally"" too literally? Randy Shaw argues that they have, with destructive consequences for America. Since the 1970s, activist participation in national struggles has steadily given way to a nearly exclusive focus on local issues. America's political and corporate elite has succeeded in controlling the national agenda, while their adversaries—the citizen activists and organizations who spent decades building federal programs to reflect the country's progressive ideals—increasingly bypass national fights. The result has been not only the dismantling of hard-won federal programs but also the sabotaging of local agendas and community instituions by decisions made in the national arena.  Shaw urges activists and their organizations to implement a ""new national activism"" by channeling energy from closely knit local groups into broader causes. Such activism enables locally oriented activists to shape America's future and work on national fights without traveling to Washington, D.C., but instead working in their own backyards. Focusing on the David and Goliath struggle between Nike and grassroots activists critical of the company's overseas labor practices, Shaw shows how national activism can rewrite the supposedly ironclad rules of the global economy by ensuring fair wages and decent living standards for workers at home and abroad. Similarly, the recent struggles for stronger clean air standards and new federal budget priorities demonstrate the potential grassroots national activism to overcome the corporate and moneyed interests that increasingly dictate America's future.  Reclaiming America's final section describes how community-based nonprofit organizations, the media, and the Internet are critical resources for building national activism. Shaw declares that community-based groups can and must combine their service work with national grassroots advocacy.

Exploring California through a geographic lens reveals how the field has evolved to cross traditional boundaries, connect local and global issues, and provide the insights that lead to practical solutions to problems new and old. Challenging the reader to look beyond stereotypes and assumptions, this book encourages active participation in planning the state’s dynamic future. And this project makes teaching and learning about the geography of California more convenient, exciting, and rewarding for instructors and students.  Going beyond a scientific analysis of natural features and environmental processes, this book illustrates how social, political, and economic divides can be bridged through the study of geography and the connections it brings to light. From geology, weather and climate, biogeography, and hydrology, we cover the state’s physical geography. And from demography and migration, to cultures and economies, to rural and urban geography, we monitor the state’s human geography pulse and then make the vital connections. California continues to lead the nation in population, economics (5th largest in the world), agriculture, natural and cultural diversity, and a host of other categories. This powerful state has earned this powerful publication. This timely and versatile book will prove useful to Californians in business, education, government, and to concerned citizens and curious readers seeking to learn more about the Golden State.",,covers/admin/710.jpg,1

The ""Rootabaga"" stories were born of Sandburg's desire for ""American fairy tales"" to match American childhood. He felt that the European stories involving royalty and knights were inappropriate, and so set his stories in a fictionalized American Midwest called ""the Rootabaga country"" filled with farms, trains, and corn fairies.

This form of intellectual conservativism tied to the Slavophil movement of Dostoevsky's day, is seen to have continued on into its modern manifestation in individuals like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.

From the moment he caught the public's eye in the early 1980s as the iconic front man of the Smiths, and through his subsequent solo career, the patron saint of misfits has fascinated and baffled in equal measure.Yet, as Mark Simpson argues in this wickedly funny and deeply sacrilegious psycho-bio -- told through the lens of his own obsession as a lifelong fan -- Morrissey isn't quite so enigmatic as he might appear. To understand this most private (and sexually ambivalent) of stars, one need only uncover the countless clues to his personality in his startlingly candid song lyrics and his innumerable provocative interviews. Simpson deftly explores why Morrissey bewitched a generation -- and why he remains as intriguing as ever. In fact 2004 was Morrissey's best year to date, bringing his biggest-selling album, a sold-out tour, and the adulation of legions of new fans. Both an insightful look at the singer's career and a personal story of a boy's first love for his music idol, Saint Morrissey is, like its subject, shrewd, sharp-witted, charming, and utterly original.",First Edition.,covers/admin/804.jpg,1

The phenomenon has been cited throughout history in nearly every culture, along with other commonplace “paranormal” occurrences such as premonitions and telepathy.  In this newly updated edition, Sheldrake shares his more than 25 years of research into telepathy, the power of staring, remote viewing, precognition, and animal premonitions. Drawing on more than 5,000 case histories, 4,000 questionnaire responses, and the results of experiments on staring, thought transference, phone telepathy, and other phenomena carried out with more than 20,000 people as well as reports and data from dozens of independent research teams, Sheldrake shows that these unexplained human abilities--such as the sense of being stared at--are not paranormal but normal, part of our biological nature. He reveals that telepathy depends on social bonds and traces its evolution from the connections between members of animal groups such as flocks, schools, and packs.

On every page surprises leap out to delight readers. Crickets chirp, ostriches flap their wings, and blue-footed boobies dance in an endless mating ritual. There are tabs to pull, flaps to flip, and details to ponder. The text, which is basic at best, discusses ways in which mammals, fish, and birds entice, frighten, and fool each other. However, visually this book is so appealing that its point is well made. It should encourage more detailed exploration and reading by students, so this fun-filled volume is a worthy addition to nature sections. Dinosaurs is so clever and exciting that serious consideration should be given to its purchase. It's a truly three-dimensional work in which dinosaurs leap out at the turn of a page; icthyornis fly through the air; bone heads do battle at the tug of a tab. Turn a flap and a baby dinosaur pops out of an egg while a less fortunate hatchling is stolen by a lizard. The text describes most major dinosaurs as well as some that are lesser known.

T.",1874,Hardcover,"Warren, Johnson & Co, Buffalo",,Fair ,80,Sycamore: Top,Biography & Essays,,,N/A,"Phineas Taylor Barnum, popularly known as P.T. Barnum, released his own biography in 1855, titled The Life of P.T. Barnum, which includes his golden rules for money-making.  This edition is a 1888 reprint, containing essentially the same account as the original and includes a number of images and illustrations.  This volume can be well regarded as a manual of showmanship and moneymaking, given the notorious American businessman's trade and success in his chosen profession. It is quite ironic that someone who is, at the core, sort of a coward and averse to certain inconveniences, would make his stamp in history and society as a master in frauds and hoaxes via his famed Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.  The book also displays the author's eccentricity and coarseness, as well as near-sociopathic inclinations in full splendor. As such it is an amusing read, albeit long winded at times. However, the small text may challenge one's vision and makes this tome quite lengthy.  What's most interesting about this autobiography is that it is not wholly an account of the author's life. It also has self-help elements that make this book double as a marketing and racketeering manual, as earlier mentioned.  Those who admire Barnum's legacy, as well as those looking to be entertained by real life experiences of a historical figure of an intriguing reputation will do well to pick up this book.",,covers/admin/851.jpg,1

Like the unicorn himself, they are one of the marvels of the world, for in no other work of art anywhere is the pursuit and capture of this magical creatures presented in such astonishing detail, with such command of pictorial verisimilitude and symbolic intention. In a duality not rare in the late Middle Ages, the imagery is both secular and religious. The references to love, matrinmonial fidelity, and desire for progeny are understandable in an ensemble that might have celebrated a marriage. But the unicorn, at the same time, is Christ, and the compositions reflect the Incarnation, the Passion, and the Resurrection. Gabriel, the angel of the Annunciation, is one of the hunters: the unicorn loses his fierceness in the lap of the Virgin Mary; a thorny crown encircles his horn and neck when he is slain; and then the glorious creature is miraculously alive again and chained to a pomegranate tree, simultaneously an image of the risen Christ and of the lover-bridegroom secured by his adored lady.","""For Mindy from Dad and Mom, Christmas 1976"" written inside.

The first inkling of this obsession came when British photographer Luke Stephenson (born 1983) met an artist who photographed pigeons--side on, against a blank background. Impressed by the simplicity of these images, Stephenson began to photograph birds. His first subjects belonged to the treasurer of the UK Budgie Society, who deemed his portraits ""crap"" because he had omitted the legs and tails. He subsequently developed an eye for the nuances of bird photography, and, making a specialty of photographing show birds of all kinds, developed the body of work gathered in this volume. While Stephenson's photographs depict these birds with apparent neutrality (against a variety of colored backgrounds), Michael Smith observes in his foreword to this volume that ""they live in an overlap between the natural and manmade worlds, and say as much about the culture that created them as they do about nature.",Cute little book with photos of show birds.,covers/admin/1056.jpg,1

Although relatively young and new to the field, Franchi has already received worldwide acclaim for his distinctive graphic and Edited byial design of IL--Intelligence in Lifestyle, an Italian magazine now widely considered to be a modern classic. With Designing News, Franchi conveys his vision for the future of news and the media industry. Based on personal insight and experience, he offers valuable analysis and perspectives on the fundamental changes that are taking place in the way media is being used. Franchi explores consumer behaviors and expectations that represent the biggest challenges facing traditional publishing houses and broadcasting companies as well as journalists and designers. For Franchi, reporting is not merely filing a story once, but rather telling a continuous narrative in a way that is most relevant for a broad range of traditional and digital media--from breaking news to analysis, from interviews to commentaries, and from photo essays and illustrations to information graphics and interactive visualizations of data. In this book, Franchi explains the ramifications of this development and how newspapers can become credible, comprehensive news brands. In Designing News, Franchi also outlines a new, integrated approach for Edited byial designers.

I reduce the subject to the simplest possible visual terms without losing identity, thereby enhancing identity."" Harper's approach to depicting the natural world is both sophisticated and fun.

The Floating Piers (English and Italian Edition),"Volz, Wolfgang & Jonathan William Henery",2016,Paperback,Taschen,Christo and Jeanne-Claude,Good,20,Aaron & Tina's,"Art, Fine-Art",,,N/A," From June 18 to July 3, 2016, 100 kilometers east of Milan and 200 kilometers west of Venice, thousands of people will walk on water. The Floating Piers by Christo and Jeanne-Claude deploys 70,000 square meters of shimmering yellow fabric above a modular floating dock system of 220,000 high-density polyethylene cubes to create a temporary three-kilometer walkway across the surface of Lake Iseo, connecting the mainland to the islands of Monte Isola and San Paolo.  The piers are 16 meters wide and approximately 40 centimeters high, with sloping sides. Visitors experience the artwork by walking from Sulzano to Monte Isola and over to San Paolo. The mountains surrounding the lake also offer a bird’s-eye view of the project, revealing unnoticed angles and perspectives.  The Floating Piers is Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s first large-scale project since they realized The Gates in 2005 and draws upon their established history of projects in Italy, including Wrapped Fountain and Wrapped Medieval Tower in Spoleto, 1968; Wrapped Monuments in Milan, 1970; and The Wall – Wrapped Roman Wall in Rome, 1973–74. As with all of Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s projects, The Floating Piers is funded entirely through the sale of Christo’s original works of art. After the 16-day exhibition, all components will be removed and recycled.  This book presents rich photographic coverage of The Floating Piers alongside sketches, models, documents and designs, revealing the process behind this waterborne work of art.

For over four decades, Weiner has defined art as a representation of relationships in the physical world—“the relationship of human beings to objects and objects to objects in relation to human beings.” This highly anticipated publication represents the full range of Weiner’s practice, from the early 1960s to the present, from his early paintings to his work in language, including works on paper, films, videos, books, and public commissions. Weiner adopted language as his primary material in 1968. According to his landmark STATEMENT OF INTENT, an oft-quoted declaration first published in 1969, each work can be constructed by the artist, fabricated by someone else, or need not be built at all and simply presented in language. Weiner’s work is often manifested outside the gallery context—through postcards, billboards, lectures, or even on a series of cast-iron manhole covers for the city of New York.This substantial publication, produced in conjunction with the artist’s first major retrospective in the United States and in close collaboration with the artist, constitutes Weiner’s largest monograph to date and brings together five esteemed scholars along with Turner Prize finalist Liam Gillick to examine the artist’s impact on the art world today.",,covers/admin/1349.jpg,1

The core of these ideas were first presented by Müller-Brockmann who helped to spread the knowledge about the grids thorough the world.

With it landed Bowie's Stardust alter ego: a glitter-clad, mascara-eyed, sexually ambiguous persona who kicked down the boundaries between male and female, straight and gay, fact and fiction into one shifting and sparkling phenomenon of '70s self-expression. Together, Ziggy the album and Ziggy the stage spectacular propelled the softly spoken Londoner into one of the world's biggest stars.A key passenger on this glam trip into the stratosphere was fellow Londoner and photographer Mick Rock. Rock bonded with Bowie artistically and personally, immersed himself in the singer's inner circle, and, between 1972 and 1973, worked as the singer's photographer and videographer.This collection brings together spectacular stage shots, iconic photo shoots, as well as intimate backstage portraits. It celebrates Bowie's fearless experimentation and reinvention, while offering privileged access to the many facets of his personality and fame.

Unlike a traditional monograph, Roettinger's re-imagined interpretation is a testament to the process itself, and underscores the duality of his approach, which is both visibly chaotic and meticulously organized.",,covers/admin/1384.jpg,1

Using 2x4’s own collaborations and projects as examples, and drawing on the experience of the contributing authors, the result is not a clinical textbook, but a fantastic and thought-provoking work about the limitless applications of design. A must-have for design students and professionals, Multiple Signatures challenges standard ways of understanding design and inspires readers to think of graphic design as a building block for all creative disciplines.",,covers/admin/1385.jpg,1

Studioilse, the award-winning design studio founded by Ilse Crawford, bridges the worlds of interior design, architecture, and product design with the philosophy of putting the human being at the center. Fascinated by what drives us and makes us feel alive, Crawford says: ""When I look at making spaces, I don’t just look at the visual. I’m much more interested in the sensory thing, in thinking about it from the human context, the primal perspective, the thing that touches you."" Featuring Studioilse’s work to date, from private residences to hotels, restaurants, and retail projects, this book illustrates the effectiveness of design grounded in human needs and desires. Layering materials and textures, combined with her understanding of human behavior, Crawford’s designs are sensual and accessible. A forerunner of the holistic design movement a decade ago, her humanistic approach has now become the norm. This volume illustrates why Crawford’s design philosophy is so seminal—her work has influenced not only a generation of Dutch and European designers, but also Americans due to her acclaimed Soho House New York. With new photography and essays by Crawford and design critic Edwin Heatcote, this inspirational volume is sure to be one of the most important design books of the year.",,covers/admin/1418.jpg,1

""In my work,"" he says, ""I found that I could be the master of my own universe and control what people see and pay attention to."" For Baldessari, keen as he is to minimize or erase his own manual presence, printmaking also helps to flatten out these collaged additions and interventions, heightening their sense of estrangement and beguiling anonymity. Many of Baldessari's prints series have been extremely influential, such as the 1970s Raw Prints series, for which he amended photos of Santa Monica mallgoers with abstracted shapes printed above the images that replicate details from them; this series was pivotal in democratizing photo-based prints in the art world. Since then, Baldessari has gone on to collaborate with some of the world's great printmakers, such as Brooke Alexander, Gemini G.E.L., Cirrus Editions, Edition Jacob Samuel, Mixographia and Crown Point Press.

1450,Merce Cunningham: Common Time,N/A,2017,Hardcover,Walker Art Center,N/A,Like New,40,Aaron & Tina's,"Collections, Catalogs & Exhibitions",5.07,456,978-1935963141,"Renowned as both choreographer and dancer, Merce Cunningham (1919-2009) also revolutionized dance through his partnerships with the many artists who created costumes, lighting, films and videos, and décor and sound for his choreographic works. Cunningham, together with partner John Cage, invited those artists to help him rethink what dance could mean, both on the stage and in site-responsive contexts. His notion that movement, sound and visual art could share a ""common time"" remains one of the most radical aesthetic models of the 20th century and yielded extraordinary works by dozens of artists and composers, including Charles Atlas, John Cage, Morris Graves, Jasper Johns, Rei Kawakubo, Robert Morris, Gordon Mumma, Bruce Nauman, Ernesto Neto, Pauline Oliveros, Nam June Paik, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella, David Tudor, Stan VanDerBeek, Andy Warhol and La Monte Young, among many others. These collaborations bring to the fore Cunningham's direct impact upon postwar artistic practice.  This 456-page volume, published in conjunction with the Walker Art Center and MCA Chicago's exhibition, reconsiders the choreographer and his collaborators as an extraordinarily generative interdisciplinary network that preceded and predicted dramatic shifts in performance, including the development of site-specific dance, the use of technology as a choreographic tool and the radical separation of sound and movement in dance. It features ten new essays by curators and historians, as well as interviews with contemporary choreographers--Beth Gill, Maria Hassabi, Rashaun Mitchell and Silas Riener--who address Cunningham's continued influence. These are supplemented by rarely published archival photographs, reprints of texts by Cunningham, Cage and other key dancers, artists and scholars, several appendices and an extensive illustrated chronology placing Cunningham's activities and those of his collaborators in the context of the 20th century, particularly the expanded arts scene of the 1960s and 1970s.

Originally published as a boxed set by Doubleday in 1970, the book was accompanied by large graphic posters that could serve as a portable learning environment for a new process-based model of education, and a bibliography and checklist that map patterns and relationships between radical thought and artistic practices―from the modernist avant-gardes to postmodernism, from the Bauhaus to Black Mountain College, from Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin to Buckminster Fuller and Norman O. Brown―with Herbert Marcuse and Marshall McLuhan serving as points of anchorage. Blueprint for Counter Education thus serves as a vital synthesis of the numerous intellectual currents in the countercultural debate on the radical reform of schools, universities and ways of learning.

This book reproduces close to 600 'word' artworks by Ruscha, all of which characterize his artistic scope and identity. Assembled together in the form of a thick block, making the book and art 'object' in itself, these images become a sort of novel without an obvious plot: a series of words with no narrative but, rather, with a life of their own. Some of the works consist of only one word - great, mud, trust - and others of short combinations or phrases, such as Indeed I do, She Sure Knew Her Devotionals, Your Polyester People, That Housing Tract is Only Texture, and, of course, They Called Her Styrene.  In these works Ruscha's words transcend their apparent randomness to become visual icons of universal emotions and places known and imagined, exposing a dimension of multi-layered irony and threads of subtle and inventive social commentary.

In 83 photographs, Frank looked beneath the surface of American life to reveal a people plagued by racism, ill-served by their politicians and rendered numb by a rapidly expanding culture of consumption. Yet he also found novel areas of beauty in simple, overlooked corners of American life. And it was not just Frank's subject matter--cars, jukeboxes and even the road itself―that redefined the icons of America; it was also his seemingly intuitive, immediate, off-kilter style, as well as his method of brilliantly linking his photographs together thematically, conceptually, formally and linguistically, that made The Americans so innovative.

Within this repertoire of sensual contours and natural motifs, Art Nouveau also followed the example of the English Arts and Crafts movement to emphasize a return to handcraftsmanship and the synthesis of artistic media and practices into a Gesamtkunstwerk, or total work of art.

Peter Herring was the center of Anne's universe in college, and now, a few years later, he's become the center of Anna's, and merely a minor player in his ex-girlfriend's world. That is, until Peter and Anna are invited into Anne's parents' home to visit with her dying mother, and he finds himself drawn back into her orbit.  Years later, when her own mother is dying, Anna will find herself yearning to reach out to Anne, with whom she had shared such a brief but intimate bond, and find solace in that moment from long ago. Perspective evolves with time, and so with time, what Peter means to each woman -- as lover, as friend, as connection to the past -- also evolves.  Through exploring Anne's and Anna's ties to Peter and unfolding the narratives of the people who weave meaningfully in and out of their lives, Polly Dugan reveals the power of family secrets, the ripple effects of her characters' emotional choices, and how poignantly their intertwined relationships shape who they are and how they love.  Possessing that rare ability to write the sweep of emotion with tenderness, Polly Dugan invites readers to witness the moments that define her characters -- the moments that come back full circle to comfort or haunt them, or both.

Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write ""something new--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple + intricately patterned."" That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel became The Great Gatsby, arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known. A portrait of the Jazz Age in all of its decadence and excess, Gatsby captured the spirit of the author's generation and earned itself a permanent place in American mythology. Self-made, self-invented millionaire Jay Gatsby embodies some of Fitzgerald's--and his country's--most abiding obsessions: money, ambition, greed, and the promise of new beginnings. ""Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgiastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning--"" Gatsby's rise to glory and eventual fall from grace becomes a kind of cautionary tale about the American Dream. It's also a love story, of sorts, the narrative of Gatsby's quixotic passion for Daisy Buchanan. The pair meet five years before the novel begins, when Daisy is a legendary young Louisville beauty and Gatsby an impoverished officer. They fall in love, but while Gatsby serves overseas, Daisy marries the brutal, bullying, but extremely rich Tom Buchanan. After the war, Gatsby devotes himself blindly to the pursuit of wealth by whatever means--and to the pursuit of Daisy, which amounts to the same thing. ""Her voice is full of money,"" Gatsby says admiringly, in one of the novel's more famous descriptions. His millions made, Gatsby buys a mansion across Long Island Sound from Daisy's patrician East Egg address, throws lavish parties, and waits for her to appear. When she does, events unfold with all the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama, with detached, cynical neighbor Nick Carraway acting as chorus throughout.",,covers/admin/1573.jpg,1

Today’s resurgence in minimalist graphic design—as creators move away from the ornate, decorative patterns that have saturated our visual culture for the past decade—calls for a closer look at the movement in its new, contemporary context.  Min showcases around 150 outstanding minimalist designers working across a wide range of formats and media—from independent magazines and album cover designs to corporate identity and branding.

Something as simple as color choices can render a product unusable for millions. These mismatches are the building blocks of exclusion. In Mismatch, Kat Holmes describes how design can lead to exclusion, and how design can also remedy exclusion. Inclusive design methods—designing objects with rather than for excluded users—can create elegant solutions that work well and benefit all.  Holmes tells stories of pioneers of inclusive design, many of whom were drawn to work on inclusion because of their own experiences of exclusion. A gamer and designer who depends on voice recognition shows Holmes his “Wall of Exclusion,” which displays dozens of game controllers that require two hands to operate; an architect shares her firsthand knowledge of how design can fail communities, gleaned from growing up in Detroit's housing projects; an astronomer who began to lose her eyesight adapts a technique called “sonification” so she can “listen” to the stars.  Designing for inclusion is not a feel-good sideline. Holmes shows how inclusion can be a source of innovation and growth, especially for digital technologies. It can be a catalyst for creativity and a boost for the bottom line as a customer base expands. And each time we remedy a mismatched interaction, we create an opportunity for more people to contribute to society in meaningful ways.",,covers/admin/1597.jpg,1

When a designed product's usefulness is past, the public happily discards it to make room for the next new thing. Criticism rarely deals with how a product might be used, or not used, over time; it is more likely to play the enabler, encouraging our addiction to consumption. With Sifting the Trash, Alice Twemlow offers an especially timely reexamination of the history of product design criticism through the metaphors and actualities of the product as imminent junk and the consumer as junkie.  Twemlow explores five key moments over the past sixty years of product design criticism. From the mid-1950s through the 1960s, for example, critics including Reyner Banham, Deborah Allen, and Richard Hamilton wrote about the ways people actually used design, and invented a new kind of criticism. At the 1970 International Design Conference in Aspen, environmental activists protested the design establishment's lack of political engagement. In the 1980s, left-leaning cultural critics introduced ideology to British design criticism. In the 1990s, dueling London exhibits offered alternative views of contemporary design. And in the early 2000s, professional critics were challenged by energetic design bloggers. Through the years, Twemlow shows, critics either sifted the trash and assigned value or attempted to detect, diagnose, and treat the sickness of a consumer society.",,covers/admin/1598.jpg,1

The coexistence of different visual cultures is now part of our daily lives and a given feature of our communication systems. But how do we best present information, structures and designs from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds?  Visual communication has classically been guided by principles of uniformity and simplification, values that seem unable to adequately cope with the coexistence of different systems of representation. How can we set up equitable systems for cross-cultural communication that honor the diversity of writing systems? What new design values are needed for an age of global communications?  In Visual Coexistence, graphic designer Ruedi Baur leads a research team in investigating and analyzing visual graphics from different cultures, with a focus on Chinese and Latin writing systems, in order to identify their specific principles of depiction and the ways in which they visually communicate. From this interdisciplinary, intercultural investigation, the designers recommend appropriate, differentiated design solutions for global communication. Exploring the problems and possibilities of multilingual typography and visual representation, Visual Coexistence advocates for design as a tool of global understanding.","by Ruedi Baur (Editor, Contributor), Ulrike Felsing (Editor, Contributor), Sébastien Fasel (Contributor), Fabienne Kilchör (Contributor), Eva Lüdi Kong (Contributor), Marco Maione (Contributor), Roman Wilhelm (Contributor)",covers/admin/1631.jpg,1

It deals with grid-based design and gives the reader techniques to develop new forms, fonts, logos, and patterns. The concept represents a design process in which individual decisions follow much larger and deeper principles than immediate and spontaneous-intuitive actions. Using a wide variety of examples, each chapter contains a detailed description of the procedure from form analysis to setting up design rules and their application. Both a workbook and a source of inspiration, this publication provides designers and architects with the tool they need to find analytical forms analog, algorithm-based, exploratory but never of arbitrary origin. The procedures described allow an almost infinite number of possibilities. The designer is thus transformed from inventor to interpreter or curator, who assesses individual forms for logos, fonts or patterns on the fly and ensures that the design process is always efficient and goal-oriented. AUTHOR: Christoph Grunberger is a German illustrator and designer. He is active in the fields of corporate, interactive and spatial design, with a strong focus on exploring the limits of interaction and desktop applications. Together with Stefan Gandl he is co-author of the book Neubau Modul and collaborated on the exhibition NeubauIsm at gallery MU (Eindhoven/NL) in 2008, which was opened by Wim Crouwel.

In many cases, though, the same sound business practices apply whether you are producing cars or carrots. Author Ben Hartman and other young farmers are increasingly finding that incorporating the best new ideas from business into their farming can drastically cut their wastes and increase their profits, making their farms more environmentally and economically sustainable. By explaining the lean system for identifying and eliminating waste and introducing efficiency in every aspect of the farm operation, The Lean Farm makes the case that small-scale farming can be an attractive career option for young people who are interested in growing food for their community.  Working smarter, not harder, also prevents the kind of burnout that start-up farmers often encounter in the face of long, hard, backbreaking labor.  Lean principles grew out of the Japanese automotive industry, but they are now being followed on progressive farms around the world.

This unprecedented TASCHEN publication, authored by Jens Müller, brings together approximately 6,000 trademarks, focused on the period 1940–1980, to examine how modernist attitudes and imperatives gave birth to corporate identity. Ranging from media outfits to retail giants, airlines to art galleries, the sweeping survey is organized into three design-orientated chapters: Geometric, Effect, and Typographic. Each chapter is then sub-divided into form and style led sections such as alphabet, overlay, dots and squares.  Alongside the comprehensive catalog, the book features an introduction from Jens Müller on the history of logos, and an essay by R. Roger Remington on modernism and graphic design. Eight designer profiles and eight instructive case studies are also included, with a detailed look at the life and work of such luminaries as Paul Rand, Yusaku Kamekura, and Anton Stankowski, and at such significant projects as Fiat, The Daiei Inc., and the Mexico Olympic Games of 1968. An unrivaled resource for graphic designers, advertisers, and branding specialists, Logo Modernism is equally fascinating to anyone interested in social, cultural, and corporate history, and in the sheer persuasive power of image and form.",,covers/admin/1667.jpg,1

For 'American Winter', Johansson travelled through semi-deserted towns in Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming and Colorado, finding as much beauty as there was misery in landscapes cloaked in snow: an isolated church floating in a mottled sea of white; leafless trees lining endless highways leading to nothing; long shadows cast on vernacular architecture in the season's merciless sun. In his photographs time appears to stand still: neighbourhoods that once possessed the allure of Art Deco architecture, or the glory of bustling Main Streets, are now home to abandoned school buildings and cars parked decades ago. Johansson's ascetic framing and sensitivity to light lends itself to the scenery and the sense of hopelessness evoked by these neglected places ",,covers/admin/1668.jpg,1

With more than 1,400 illustrations, many of them never published before and written by the leading design historian Pat Kirkham, this is the definitive study that design and film enthusiasts have been eagerly anticipating. Saul Bass (1920-1996) created some of the most compelling images of American post-war visual culture. Having extended the remit of graphic design to include film titles, he went on to transform the genre. His best known works include a series of unforgettable posters and title sequences for films such as Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo and Otto Preminger's The Man With The Golden Arm and Anatomy of a Murder. He also created some of the most famous logos and corporate identity campaigns of the century, including those for major companies such as AT&T, Quaker Oats, United Airlines and Minolta. His wife and collaborator, Elaine, joined the Bass office in the late 1950s. Together they created an impressive series of award-winning short films, including the Oscar-winning Why Man Creates, as well as an equally impressive series of film titles, ranging from Stanley Kubrick s Spartacus in the early 1960s to Martin Scorsese s Cape Fear and Casino in the 1990s. Designed by Jennifer Bass, Saul Bass's daughter and written by distinguished design historian Pat Kirkham who knew Saul Bass personally, this book is full of images from the Bass archive, providing an in depth account of one of the leading graphic artists of the 20th century.",Birthday present from Tina,covers/admin/1670.jpg,1

AZTDR(tm) spans over three decades of work - from the studio's earliest designs for the FON label in the mid-1980s and sleeves for Age of Chance, Chakk and Cabaret Voltaire, right up to its recent projects for The Cinematic Orchestra, Led Bib and the Gulbenkian Foundation. Alongside classic self-initiated TDR(tm) projects, the 512-page book features an A to Z of everything from campaigns for Evolution Print, Coca-Cola and Nike, through to the studio's celebrated designs for video games such as Wipeout and Formula Fusion.  TDR(tm)'s special relationship with print is explored through its celebrated contributions to IDEA and Emigre magazines and its 3D>2D book, alongside its work for Manchester School of Art, Gatecrasher, NY Sushi and the studio's array of music clients. Here, TDR(tm)'s work with Autechre is examined via ten key releases, while the studio's involvement with Pop Will Eat Itself focuses on some twenty-eight different singles and albums. There are also expansive sections devoted to TDR(tm)'s designs for Aphex Twin, Moloko, Sun Electric and The Orb, alongside sleeve designs for R&S Records, New Atlantis, a range of Berlin-based labels and, of course, Warp Records.","Edition of 500, ",covers/admin/1734.jpg,1

In Deformer he presented the photographs under the theme of suburbia. Wayward Cognitions represents the in-between moments that arise when shooting in the streets without theme or subject. ""It's about looking, people watching, finding pleasure in the visual vignettes we glimpse each day,"" says Templeton. When those moments are removed from the context in which they were shot, dynamic stories can be told or imagined in book form. The photographs in Wayward Cognitions were printed by Templeton in his darkroom; he then created the layout and design himself, building the book from scratch in his home studio.",,covers/admin/1752.jpg,1

1786,Breakfast of Champions,"Vonnegut, Kurt",1973,Paperback,Delta Book (Dell),"Vonnegut, Kurt",Used,15,Aaron & Tina's,"Fiction, Novel",0.8,295,N/A,"Breakfast of Champions (1973) provides frantic, scattershot satire and a collage of Vonnegut's obsessions. His recurring cast of characters and American landscape was perhaps the most controversial of his canon; it was felt by many at the time to be a disappointing successor to Slaughterhouse-Five, which had made Vonnegut's literary reputation.  The core of the novel is Kilgore Trout, a familiar character very deliberately modeled on the science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon (1918-1985), a fact that Vonnegut conceded frequently in interviews and that was based upon his own occasional relationship with Sturgeon. Here Kilgore Trout is an itinerant wandering from one science fiction convention to another; he intersects with the protagonist, Dwayne Hoover (one of Vonnegut's typically boosterish, lost, and stupid mid-American characters), and their intersection is the excuse for the evocation of many others, familiar and unfamiliar, dredged from Vonnegut's gallery. The central issue is concerned with intersecting and apposite views of reality, and much of the narrative is filtered through Trout, who is neither certifiably insane nor a visionary writer but can pass for either depending upon Dwayne Hoover's (and Vonnegut's) view of the situation.  America, when this novel was published, was in the throes of Nixon, Watergate, and the unraveling of our intervention in Vietnam; the nation was beginning to fragment ideologically and geographically, and Vonnegut sought to cram all of this dysfunction (and a goofy, desperate kind of hope, the irrational comfort given through the genre of science fiction) into a sprawling narrative whose sense, if any, is situational, not conceptual. Reviews were polarized; the novel was celebrated for its bizarre aspects and became the basis of a Bruce Willis movie adaptation whose reviews were not nearly so polarized.

The human machine is the body as not only a fixed framework but also as a complex work of art which moves and was designed to move. In over 400 drawings, George B. Bridgman demonstrates the machine through the presentations which made him a gifted lecturer and teacher in his nearly fifty years at the Art Students League in New York and which gave life to drawings by his many students during those years. All skeletal and muscular systems are fully identified, and all are shown in front, back, and side views. The Human Machine begins with the framework of bones. In each section (head, neck, hand, arm, forearm, elbow, trunk, shoulder, back, scapular region, pelvis, hip, thigh, leg, knee, foot, and toe as well as the combinations of the major sections working together), George Bridgman starts with the skeletal components of the system; then he adds the muscles, shows the changes in the muscles as the body moves and, finally, shows the appearance of the bodily section in action. At the title implies, Bridgman, throughout, supplements his anatomical work with comparative drawings of simple machines. The anatomical approach to figure drawing is the foundation for the study of human form, and as in his other books on figure drawing, Bridgman's Life Drawing and The Book of a Hundred Hands, Bridgman's approach to the subject is important and unique. The Human Machine will give students and serious artists the conception of the human structure as the complex of beautiful machines it is, and will show how bone and muscle structures are solely responsible for our movements and for the shapes which we, at various times, display.","""Luke Kapor, 11/25/79, San Francisco"" written on the inside.",covers/admin/1797.jpg,1

The Tale of Peter Rabbit was first published by Frederick Warne in 1902 and endures as Beatrix Potter's most popular and well-loved tale. It tells the story of a very mischievous rabbit and the trouble he encounters in Mr McGregor's vegetable garden! Re-originated in 2002 to mark the centenary of publication bringing it closer to the original edition, six illustrations were restored, four that were removed in 1903 to make room for endpapers and two that have never been used before, Beatrix having initially prepared more illustrations than could be accommodated in the original format. Beatrix Potter is regarded as one of the world's best-loved children's authors of all time. From her first book, The Tale of Peter Rabbit, published by Frederick Warne in 1902, she went on to create a series of stories based around animal characters including Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, Benjamin Bunny, Jemima Puddle-duck, Mr. Jeremy Fisher and Tom Kitten. Her humorous, lively tales and beautiful illustrations have become a natural part of childhood. With revenue from the sales of her books, Beatrix Potter bought a farm - Hill Top - in the English Lake District, where she later became a farmer and prize-winning sheep breeder. She launched the now vast merchandise programme by patenting the very first Peter Rabbit doll in 1903. The product range continues to grow today with licences around the world including baby clothing and bedding, nursery decor products and collectables. Upon her death, Beatrix Potter left 14 farms and over 4000 acres of Lake District farmland to the National Trust so that the place that she loved would remain undeveloped and protected for future generations to enjoy.","#1 of 23 ""Little Books""",covers/admin/1826.jpg,1

""The lake may take pity on him; but the Governor, never,"" says Tell. His opinion of the bloodthirsty Gessler is shared increasingly by the peasantry as the oppressor fills the old jails, builds a huge new prison at Altdorf for more victims, and sets his cap upon a pole before it, commanding that all who pass must bow to it or pay the penalty of death.

Drawing upon hundreds of letters, diaries, memoirs, and journals as well as the latest scholarship, THE WEST chronicles the arrival of wave after wave of newcomers from every direction of the compass. The cast is as rich and diverse as the western landscape itself--explorers, soldiers, Indian warriors, settlers, railroad builders and gaudy showmen. Coronado, Custer, Jesse James, Chief Joseph, Brigham Young and Buffalo Bill are all here. So are scores of lesser-known westerners whose stories are no less compelling--a Chinese ditchdigger. a rich Mexican landowner, a forty-niner from Chile, a Texas cowboy born in Britain, a woman missionary to the Indians who loathed the West and a Wellesley graduate who loved it in spite of everything it did to her and her family. It is the central story of America, a story filled with heroism and hope, enterprise and adventure as well as tragedy and disappointment. THE WEST explores the tensions between whites and the native peoples they sought to displace, but it also encompasses the Hispanic experience in the West from the time of the conquistadors to the transformation of a Mexican-American village called Los Angeles into the region's major metropolis, the lives of Chinese immigrants who called the region ""Gold Mountain"", and the ordeals of freed slaves from the South who sought a better life homesteading on the Great Plains.

Many of its prisoners are beyond remembrance. Their very names have been forgotten. Most of those whom history commemorates are drawn from the long roll of kings and queens, statesmen and ecclesiastics committed to its towers, which only too often they exchanged for the still narrower straitness of the grave. This booklet offers a brief but engaging look at some of the more memorable prisoners, from the rapacious prelate Ranulf Flambard, Bishop of Durham and minister of William II, who was imprisoned in 1100 (and later escaped), to Rudolf Hess, Adolf Hitler’s deputy during World War II.","""8-8-81"" written inside.",covers/admin/1906.jpg,1
